# Foyer: A package for atom-typing as well as applying and disseminating forcefields

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mosdef-hub/foyer_tutorials/master)

Contained in this repository are a series of tutorials to introduce new
users to the [Foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer) package for
constructing molecular systems. The user is referred to
[Foyer's documentation](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer/blob/master/docs/installation.md)
for installation instructions.

### How do I run these tutorials?

The Foyer tutorials can be completed in two ways:

 1. Creating the proper Python environment (the user is again referred to Foyer's installation instructions), cloning this repository, and launcing a local Jupyter notebook server with `jupyter notebook`

 2. Using our [Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mosdef-hub/foyer_tutorials/master), where a Jupyter notebook server will be launched in the cloud with the proper Python environment pre-configured.
