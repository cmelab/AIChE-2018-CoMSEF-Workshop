## Bulk Alkane (united-atom representation)

This directory contains an example for creating a boxes of alkane chains, that
feature a united-atom representation, using mBuild, atom-typing these systems 
according to the TraPPE force field using Foyer, and using the output data files to
perform molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS.
