Topology files (also sometimes called 'top', parameter, parameter/topology, or 'prmtop' files, among other names) are paired with coordinate files, and encode the \"special sauce\" of chemistry that translates a list of coordinates into a model system. These files contain information like atom types, bond topology, residue names, and so on. More on this a little later.\n",

However, in proteins there are some cases where it is not obvious whether or not a hydrogen is missing: titratible residues.

The method we chose here, `PME`, stands for Particle Mesh Ewald, and is considered quite standard. A related concept, the `nonbondedCutoff` indicates the distance beyond which the system will ignore (not bother to calculate) interaction potentials. This is fundamentally a time-saving approximation, but it is generally agreed-upon that interactions beyond about 8 Å do not meaningfully influence simulations. Finally, for the `constraints` keyword, we set `HBonds`. This setting tells the software to fix the bondlengths of all covalent hydrogen bonds. Without this setting, covalent hydrogen bonds vibrate rapidly and make calculations slower, but fixing them is unlikely to significantly change the energetics of the system, so this is a good opportunity for time-saving!"
